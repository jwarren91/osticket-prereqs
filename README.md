Here is where you will create your virtual machine in Azure. Name the virtual machine with something that you can remember and also enable a user name and password. The user name and password are for when you sign into your Remote Desktop Connection.
Use whichever region is availalbe or recommended for your area.

<p>
Download osTicket and make sure to put the file in the necessary folder. Once this is done, you will have osTicket officially on your Remote Desktop Connection. From here you can move on to assign permissions for users.

For this example, I use everyone as an example for how to give permissions in osTicket. When setting up a live osTicket, do not give everyone permissions.
